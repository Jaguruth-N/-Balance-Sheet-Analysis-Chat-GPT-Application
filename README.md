        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
    * On macOS/Linux (Bash):
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6.  **Configure Your API Key**
    * Create a folder named `.streamlit` in the root of your project directory.
    * Inside the `.streamlit` folder, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
    * Add your Google Gemini API key to this file:
        ```toml
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```

7.  **Download Sample Data**
    * Create a folder named `data` in the root directory.
